The Mobile ARM Disassembler project draws inspiration from industry-leading
reverse engineering tools such as IDA Pro by Hex-Rays and Ghidra by the
National Security Agency. While this Software is an independent implementation,
these tools have influenced its design goals, particularly in providing a robust
and user-friendly interface for ELF file analysis and ARM disassembly.

The Software is built using the following open-source libraries and tools,
each governed by their respective licenses:

- **AndroidX and Jetpack Compose**: Licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
  Copyright (c) Google LLC. See https://android.googlesource.com/ for details.
- **Kotlin and Kotlin Coroutines**: Licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
  Copyright (c) JetBrains s.r.o. and contributors. See https://kotlinlang.org/.
- **Android Native Development Kit (NDK)**: Licensed under various open-source
  licenses, primarily Apache License 2.0 and BSD. Copyright (c) Google LLC.
  See https://developer.android.com/ndk/.
- **Capstone Disassembly Framework** (optional, if enabled): Licensed under the
  BSD License. Copyright (c) Nguyen Anh Quynh and contributors.
  See https://www.capstone-engine.org/.

The native library (`mobilearmdisassembler`) is an original implementation for
ELF parsing and ARM disassembly, optimized with C++17 and link-time optimization
(LTO), and links to Android's `log` library under the Apache License 2.0.

Contributions to the Software are welcome under the terms of this license.
Contributors retain copyright to their contributions but grant the same rights
as outlined above to the project maintainers and users.
